Can you hear crickets? A little bit of flittering. Did your trash cans get knocked over in the night? I know what it is, it's the Red Mantis that prowl the desert!

Not many people have seen one, most likely because anyone it does see normally ends up dead, but I saw one; I saw it scurrying away into the desert last night. It was red and shiny and had huge black eyes.

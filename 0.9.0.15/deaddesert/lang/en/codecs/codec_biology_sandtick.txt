Ticks, ticks, ticks, they're bloody everywhere! These horrible little critters make my skin crawl. Sure they're no threat to the colony but these parasites eat our crops, drink from our toilets and once I even woke up to one in my bed! I didn't know I was signing up for giant desert ticks sharing bunk with me!`n
Still, as with all the creepy crawlies on this forsaken planet they do have a use to us. Their thick fur acts as a great insulator and can be further refined to make light clothing that is sturdy. It's a wonder how these freaks stay cool under the desert sun. I guess they must just insulate their bodies and use the fur as a sort-of barrier to the suns rays.

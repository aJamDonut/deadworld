"What a horrible creature; feeding on the brains of others. Pretty creepy. The first time I came across this disgusting goop it was attached to a poor clones head.
The clone seemed fine, he wasn't in pain even though he was bleeding from his crown."

In the end we held his head to a campfire to get the creep to leave. As soon as it came into contact with the flame it melted away into a small useless puddle of goop.

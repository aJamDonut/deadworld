200 years. 200 years cramped and aggitated in a smelly aired space can. That's how my misadventure among the stars begins.

Around the year 2800 the Sincorp Corporation began sending out colony ships to distant planets with the technology of cloning and creating a new colony. Why? I'll tell you WHY! PROFITS. That's it! Send 1000 space ships out to the nearest "habitable" planets and you're the first one there. Doesn't even matter if 999 of them are useless if you got that one great one. Man, I really wish I figured this out before getting on that ship.

The reason I got on the Zhuding-7 colony ship along with all the other founders was the allure of adventure. I wanted to come here, I wanted to seek new frontiers. On the day of boarding I didn't feel that way. I felt like it was some form of road trip for a bunch of normy humans who would support their life through a mixture of ExtendYoLyf agents, partying and cryosleep to shake off the hangovers.

And I was right... That sinking feeling as the rocket took off from home, I put it down to nerves but I know now that I sensed the inevitable failure of this journey.

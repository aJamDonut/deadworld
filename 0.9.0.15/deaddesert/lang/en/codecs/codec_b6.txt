Whenever I think about the wildlife on this planet I don't know whether to laugh, cry or both. We thought it was great news when we saw the first creatures walking around the place. Food, skins and more; animalia and plant life can really boost a colonization efforts on an unknown planet.

And reality sets in, why this planet is the Dead Desert. Sure you can maybe get a bit of meat off one of these creatures, if it doesn't kill you first! It feels like everything on this planet just wants to eat you.

It makes sense though. All these creatures who are destructive, well defended and hard to kill. This is a desert after all; resources are scarce and competition for survival is fierce. About the least dangerous thing on this planet is the desert tick and even they've been known to kill a clone or two.

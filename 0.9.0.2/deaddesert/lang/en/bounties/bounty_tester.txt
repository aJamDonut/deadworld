For his crimes against The Founders it is with no hardship we provide this bounty for the head of Yama Kenshin, the Leader of the Yamakai Warriors. Yama was last sighted in the North West and is believed to have a small kingdom of followes securing his palace. He is a worthy adversary even for an elite assassin and therefore the remuneration reflects this. The bounty will be paid upon receiving Yama Kenshin's head in The Founders capital of Ladzo City.

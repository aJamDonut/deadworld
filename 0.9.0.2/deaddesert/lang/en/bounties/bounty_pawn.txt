For crimes against the corporation including manslaughter and theft this notice is hereby granted to all hunters to assassinate the Bandit Leader called Pawn by any means necessary.
Pawn was last sighted east of Landzo city; it looks like they've set up a small camp so resistance should be anticipated.

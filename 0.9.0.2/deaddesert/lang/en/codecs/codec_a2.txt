Against my duties, it is with no great ease that today I say farewell to so many founders whom I love and care for. But it's too much. The corruption within the corp has gone too far; the failed clones piling up. The failed eco projects. No more. A few founders have chosen to follow me north and set up a new research base. Maybe this new beginning is just what this planet needs.

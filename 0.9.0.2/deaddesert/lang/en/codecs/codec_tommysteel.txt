Steelinator: Save the Pizzaverse

(in red sharpie) BELONGS TO MR. RECTOR DO NOT LOSE DO NOT LOSE

[INT. PIZZA PARLOR - DAY]
[Tommy Steel, in a pizza delivery uniform and metal armor, stands at the counter, facing the pizza chef robot, PIZZATRON 5000.]

PIZZATRON 5000
Steelinator! All the pepperoni is missing!

TOMMY STEEL
Don’t worry, Pizzatron. I’ll get it back. Steel yourself for action!

[Tommy flexes his muscles, causing the "STEEL" tattoo on his chest to shine brightly.]

[INT. GALACTIC PIZZA PALACE - NIGHT]
[Tommy faces PEPPERONIUS MAXIMUS, a villainous figure with a pepperoni crown and cheese cape, in a grand palace built from pizza. The room is filled with ornate pizza-themed decor.]

PEPPERONIUS MAXIMUS
You’re too late, Steelinator! The pepperoni is mine!

TOMMY STEEL
We’ll see about that!

[Tommy pulls out a pizza box that transforms into a massive pizza cannon. He aims it at Pepperonius Maximus.]

PEPPERONIUS MAXIMUS
What’s that?

TOMMY STEEL
It’s the ultimate weapon – a pepperoni barrage!

[Tommy fires a stream of molten cheese and pepperonis, knocking the villain off his cheesy throne.]

PEPPERONIUS MAXIMUS
No! My beautiful pepperoni!

TOMMY STEEL
You’ve just been topped!

[INT. BACKSTAGE - DAY]
[The scene shifts to Tommy Steel on the set, holding a slice of pizza and grinning at the camera.]

TOMMY STEEL
And that’s how you save the Pizzaverse. Always remember to steel yourself for action – and never skimp on the toppings!

[The screen fades to black with the tagline: "Coming soon to a Sincorp theater near you!"]

Dear Mr President, I am not writing in gobble-language. Instead I am writing in American so you may understand. I have truly invented the machine of time. Here is my ultimatum: Release all my brethren from captivity or I will do it myself. I will go back in time to the first thanksgiving and take turkey's off the menu.

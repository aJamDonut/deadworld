Welcome to Dead Desert.
The game is still really early in it's development.
You will come across many bugs!
I hope you still enjoy the game and find out something cool.
HOW TO PLAY:
Use the mouse to right click and move to where you want.
Talk to NPCs, loot containers and find out where you are.
Go into the world and forge your own path.

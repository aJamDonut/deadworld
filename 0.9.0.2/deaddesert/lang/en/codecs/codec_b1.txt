So here we find ourselves, on a desert planet with low supplies; failing technology and local aliens who kill us on sight. How did I end up here? I thought I'd find adventure, friends and maybe more!

Oh well, I've gone long enough without a decents night sleep to know this isn't going to end well. Worse yet I can see the clone population growing while the human population is declining, this means eventually there must be no humans left! Imagine that! Would this even be a human colonized planet anymore? Or just some new civilization of bizarre mutated clones? A nightmare I've seen many times.

If I can't have my own adventures and humanity here is doomed, I might aswell begin to preserve the history of my time; so that clones and other cultures can learn from how this civilization began.

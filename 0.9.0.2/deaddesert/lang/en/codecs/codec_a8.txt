I'm sat here again... Asking myself... Why do I even exist... What's the point? You could just make a clone, you could just clone someone you know. Why was I even born?

Maybe if I knew my father I'd understand everything better, or atleast feel I have a reason to live. But I just don't I don't understand why I'm here, what my purpose is.

Mothers getting old now and has become almost completely resistant to ExtendYoLife she still has plenty of energy and is still extremely capable, but her body is just so weak that extended working or travelling really exhausts her.

Sometimes I wonder if I should go North and look for my father... but I don't think I should leave Mother just yet...

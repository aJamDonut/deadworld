What the frack did I just witness. This will haunt my nightmares forever. What was that thing. 3 heads, no wait 4... 2 mouths, creepy ass legs. What the hell was that? We were in a science outpost when all of a sudden one of these disgusting things darts across the floor. I've never seen Bob run so fast in my life, I'm sure he was back in Landzo before we saw the damn thing move! I must have heard it cutting into several clones before finally purging the main hall and abandoning the building. God knows if it survived. Thank god we only lost the clones in there, not a single human life lost!

I wouldn't even know where to start on the biology or utility of this creature. It's clearly some form of experiment gone wrong, but from where and by who? I have no idea. The creature appears to be extremely agile and dangerous. Maybe we could devise a trap sometime to capture one for study.

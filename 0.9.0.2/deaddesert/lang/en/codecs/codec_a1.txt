It's so fascinating. Earth. The blue marble. Phhwar. I had another dream about it last night. I was falling from space towards the planet. I could see the trees flying past me. And then a huge waterfall. I dived towards it and into the ocean.
I took a deep breathe under the water and could breathe cleaner air than I had ever before. It was so refreshing. This was Earth, mother. I knew her; yet without meeting her. I hugged her and wished I could stay. And then the inevitable. I wake up to this desert. This dusty horrible crap filled bunker surrounded by weird looking clones and people I barely know.
My teacher Dr .Kenshin Yamakai left long ago, he inspired me to research Earth and told me all the different stories of him and his first family living in the Japanese countryside. I miss his stories often, and wonder if I will ever get to hear another one again.
If only the long range comms was working, I could be in touch with Dr. Yamakai, Earth, Masha and the rest of the galaxy. We wouldn't be alone anymore. Who knows, I might even be able to arrange a taxi back to Earth!
Now that Masha has left Landzo and Dad's become a controlling a-hole. I wonder why I should stay here... There's nothing here for me. Sure, I'll miss Ruoni but he's got his mother to look after.

Have I become a Tyrant? Is what Asuna says really true? I must resist letting her into my head. I'm a leader, I make decisions and I keep to them. Through thick and thin. She doesn't understand.

I feel even Ira, someone I used to see as a mother figure now resents me for making her stay when Kenshin travelled North. But still I must remain composed. Kenshin may have survived for now but the lands will take him soon without SinCorps help.

There isn't some book called 'How to deal with failing clones and rebelling staff for dummies'. Pf, I bet I could write it, number 1 best seller on the outworlds. Frack, what is this mess.

For now Ira is continuing her research into the clone failings, and Bob as useful as he is keeps her coming in to the lab every day with his energy and bad uncle jokes. I like Bob, he's a bit less scientific than you would expect a scientist to be, but hey, everyone likes Bob!

I've had to increase the security around Landzo, implementing more heavy handed tactics with the units on the ground. It's harsh but we need this control after all the recent bandit attacks and the sighting of Lokals nearby.
